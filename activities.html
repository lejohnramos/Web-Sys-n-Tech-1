                <p>
                    My primary hobby is challenging myself with things that initially seem 
                    out of reach. This mindset drives me to continuously learn new skills, 
                    tackle complex problems, and push my boundaries in both technical and 
                    creative domains.

                    me and build practical skills through hands-on projects.
