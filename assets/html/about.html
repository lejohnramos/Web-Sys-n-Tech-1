    <p class="tagline">My Journey & Story</p>

    <!-- MY STORY -->
    <section class="section">
        <h2>Who I Am</h2>
        <p class="bio">
            I'm a 20-year-old student from Quezon City, Philippines, driven by curiosity and 
            a passion for exploring things that initially seem beyond my reach. For me, learning 
            isn't just about understanding concepts—it's about pushing boundaries and discovering 
            what I'm truly capable of.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- MY JOURNEY -->
    <section class="section">
        <h2>My Journey</h2>
        <p class="bio">
            My path into development started with a simple question: "How do websites work?" 
            That curiosity led me down a rabbit hole of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. What began 
            as tinkering with code has evolved into a genuine passion for creating interactive 
            experiences that bring ideas to life.
        </p>
        <p class="bio">
            I approach learning with an explorer's mindset. Every challenge is an opportunity 
            to grow, every error is a lesson, and every small victory fuels my drive to take 
            on bigger projects. I believe in learning by doing, which is why I focus on building 
            real things rather than just studying theory.
        </p>

    <!-- PHILOSOPHY -->
    <section class="section">
        <h2>My Philosophy</h2>
        <p class="bio">
            <strong>"Anything beyond my reach"</strong> isn't just a hobby—it's a mindset. 
            I thrive on challenges that push me outside my comfort zone. Whether it's learning 
            a new programming language, solving complex problems, or creating something I've 
            never built before, I believe growth happens at the edge of what seems possible.

    <!-- GOALS -->
    <section class="section">
        <h2>Goals & Aspirations</h2>
        <p>
            My primary goal is to continuously improve my skills through hands-on projects 
            that challenge me. I want to build systems and applications that don't just work—they 
            reflect creativity, purpose, and thoughtful design.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the near future, I aim to contribute to meaningful projects, collaborate with 
            other developers, and eventually create tools that make a difference in people's lives. 
            I'm particularly interested in web development, interactive experiences, and building 
            solutions that combine functionality with engaging user experiences.
